# For pycairo fix:
# From root directory: kim/codefellows--First I installed homebrew, 
# then pkg-config, and then installed pycairo using $ brew install python cairo. 
# I installed using $ pip3 install pycairo just to make sure and it is all good. 

# used pip install pipenv to create poetry alternative environment
# then pipenv shell

# Needed to use pipenv install PyObjC like the video describes for Mac error missing AppKit
