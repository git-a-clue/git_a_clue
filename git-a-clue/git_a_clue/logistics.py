Solve the murder of John Cokos:
- Move from room to room by rolling the dice and making suggestions about who, with what, and where.
- You'll be given 6 cards to eliminate suspects, gadgets and rooms.
- Use these along with the front end website to track your suspicions.
- The TA will give you a hint if they have one.
- Once you think you've solved it, schedule some time with an instructor and complete your final whiteboard for the murder.
- The instructor will give you feedback on your accusation and judge if you've passed or failed.
- You've only got one chance so study hard.
