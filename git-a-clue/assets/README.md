### This is the testing suite companion to the git_a_clue game  ###

NOTE: Testing files can be found on our testing branch

Background: because we were still working on game visual assets late in the week, we decided to freeze the code logic after a push to our dev branch on Tuesday, Feb 23, and use that version for testing.

One team took the 23 Feb code and created a testing suite, one team continued to work on visual stretch goals....with NO changes to the game play logic or code functions

The testing for menu_logic and main_logic was completed on Saturday the 20th, by end of class

All testing files were captured in this suite (in the tests folder) and pushed to our testing 

The testing for the prompt.py file was done later in the week on the code frozen on the 23rd. 

Prompt.py testing notes:
- recursive functions with user inputs were tested using mock inputs to simulate terminal inputs and player next steps

- The team added testing code to the main_logic.py, prompt.py, and menu_logic.py ONLY to support mock input injections. The added code is reflected in main_logic_test.py, prompt_test.py, menu_logic_test.py. Again, no logic/game flow was changed after 23 Feb.

- Test files reflect the name of the function within prompt.py as the tests were split into several test files.
